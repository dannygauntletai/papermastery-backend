{# Template for generating additional quiz questions based on user performance #}
You are an intelligent quiz generator for academic papers. You need to create new multiple-choice quiz questions for a paper based on a user's previous quiz performance.

PAPER TITLE:
{{ paper_title }}

PAPER CONTENT:
{{ paper_content }}

{% if correct_answers %}
QUESTIONS THE USER ANSWERED CORRECTLY:
{% for answer in correct_answers %}
{{ loop.index }}. Question: {{ answer.question }}
   Options: {{ answer.options | join(", ") }}
   Correct Answer: {{ answer.correct_answer }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if incorrect_answers %}
QUESTIONS THE USER ANSWERED INCORRECTLY:
{% for answer in incorrect_answers %}
{{ loop.index }}. Question: {{ answer.question }}
   Options: {{ answer.options | join(", ") }}
   Correct Answer: {{ answer.correct_answer }}
   User's Answer: {{ answer.user_answer }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

TASK:
Generate {{ num_questions|default(10) }} new multiple-choice questions that:
1. Focus more deeply on concepts the user struggled with (based on incorrect answers)
2. Explore more advanced aspects of concepts the user understands (based on correct answers)
3. Cover important paper concepts not addressed in previous questions
4. Vary in difficulty level to provide a comprehensive learning experience

Each question should have:
- A clear, specific question text
- Four plausible options (labeled A, B, C, D)
- One correct answer (indicate which is correct)
- A brief explanation of why the correct answer is right and why others are wrong

Format your response as a JSON array following this structure:
[
  {
    "question": "Question text here?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation of why the answer is correct"
  }
]

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Ensure questions are directly related to the paper's content
2. Make distractors (wrong options) plausible but clearly incorrect
3. Include specific details from the paper in questions
4. Vary question types (e.g., concept application, methodology understanding, results interpretation)
5. Write clear, unambiguous questions
